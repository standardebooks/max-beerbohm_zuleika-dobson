			<p>I was in Italy when this book was first published. A year later (1912) I visited London, and I found that most of my friends and acquaintances spoke to me of <em>Zu-like-a</em>⁠—a name which I hardly recognised and thoroughly disapproved. I had always thought of the lady as <em>Zu-leek-a</em>. Surely it was thus that Joseph thought of his Wife, and Selim of his Bride? And I do hope that it is thus that any reader of these pages will think of Miss Dobson.</p>
